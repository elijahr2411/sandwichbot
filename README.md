# Discord Sandwich Bot
## Under Development
Not nearly usable and most features don't exist yet so don't bother trying to use in production.
## Goals:
- A bot from which users can "order" sandwiches
- "chefs" in the official server make (photoshop) and deliver them to the server they were ordered from
Yes, I know bots like this already exist, however most are now defunct and the only one still active just doesn't do it the way I like
