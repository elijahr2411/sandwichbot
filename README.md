# Discord Sandwich Bot
## Under Development
Not nearly usable and most features don't exist yet so don't bother trying to use in production.
## Goals:
- A bot from which users can "order" sandwiches
- "chefs" in the official server make (photoshop) and deliver them to the server they were ordered from

Yes, I know bots like this already exist, however most are now defunct and the only one still active just doesn't do it the way I like
## Running the bot
First note that in it's current state the bot is a simple test (pretty much equivalent to a Hello World) and is not ready to be used at all

If you want to test the bot, it's pretty simple.
 
### Dependencies:
```
Python => 3.9.7
Nextcord => 2.0.0a3
```

To run the bot:
1. Edit the main.py file and insert your bots token in the bottom (inside the `bot.run` field
2. Run main.py

Note that eventually a config file will be added to insert your token, but this is far from a production version.
